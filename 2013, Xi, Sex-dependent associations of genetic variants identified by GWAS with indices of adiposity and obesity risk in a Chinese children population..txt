OBJECTIVE: Recent genome-wide association studies have identified a few single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which are associated with body mass index
(BMI)/obesity. This study aimed to examine the identified associations among a
population of Chinese children.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Five SNPs (SEC16B rs10913469, SH2B1 rs4788102,
PCSK1rs6235, KCTD15 rs29941, BAT2 rs2844479) were genotyped for a group of
Chinese children (N = 2849, age range 6-18 years). A total of 1230 obese cases
and 1619 controls with normal weight were identified based on the Chinese age-
and sex-specific BMI references.
RESULTS: Of five studied variants, only two (SEC16B rs10913469, SH2B1 rs4788102) 
were nominally associated with indices of adiposity and obesity risk in girls and
only SEC16B rs10913469 in children at puberty (p < 0·05), while no statistical
associations was found for three other variants (PCSK1rs6235, KCTD15 rs29941,
BAT2 rs2844479). After false discovery rate (FDR) adjustment for multiple
testing, none were statistically significant. Further analysis indicated that the
genetic risk score (GRS) was associated with BMI, waist circumference and risk of
obesity (defined by BMI) in girls, even after FDR adjustment for multiple
testing. However, there was no statistical association of GRS with indices of
adiposity and risk of obesity in children at puberty after multiple comparison
correction.
CONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed the synthetic effect of SNPs on the indices of 
adiposity and risk of obesity in Chinese girls, but failed to replicate the
effect of five separate variants. We also did not found cumulative effect of SNPs
in children at puberty.
