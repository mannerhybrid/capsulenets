Secular trends of adiposity and motor development in preschool children since the
fifties of the last century up to the beginning of this millennium were analyzed 
so as to reveal possible changes due to continuously differentiating lifestyle.
In preschool children (n = 3678) height, weight, skinfold thickness over triceps,
subscapular, and suprailiac were measured by Harpenden caliper in 1957, 1977,
1980, 1985, 1990, and 2012. Simultaneously, motor performance was tested by
evaluating the achievements in broad jump and throwing a ball, as a marker of
adaptation to changing level of physical activity, free games, and exercise.
Along the period of five decades the values of skinfold thickness increased
significantly until 2012, mainly on the trunk. Simultaneously, the level of motor
performance significantly decreased. Modifications of the way of life during the 
mentioned five decades characterized by sedentarism and inadequate food intake as
related to energy output influenced negatively both adiposity and motor
performance already in preschool children. Mostly increased deposition of fat on 
the trunk which is considered as a marker of possible development of metabolic
syndrome was apparent already in preschool age, indicating the importance of
early intervention concerning also physical activity and availability for
exercise since early life.
