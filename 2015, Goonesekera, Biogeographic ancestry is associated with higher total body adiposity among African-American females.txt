OBJECTIVES: The prevalence of obesity is disproportionately higher among
African-Americans and Hispanics as compared to whites. We investigated the role
of biogeographic ancestry (BGA) on adiposity and changes in adiposity in the
Boston Area Community Health Survey.
METHODS: We evaluated associations between BGA, assessed via Ancestry Informative
Markers, and adiposity (body mass index (BMI), percent body fat (PBF), and
waist-to-hip ratio (WHR)) and changes in adiposity over 7 years for BMI and WHR
and 2.5 years for PBF, per 10% greater proportion of BGA using multivariable
linear regression. We also examined effect-modification by demographic and
socio-behavioral variables.
RESULTS: We observed positive associations between West-African ancestry and
cross-sectional BMI (percent difference=0.62%; 95% CI: 0.04%, 1.20%), and PBF
(Î²=0.35; 95% CI: 0.11, 0.58). We also observed significant effect-modification of
the association between West-African ancestry and BMI by gender (p-interaction:
<0.002) with a substantially greater association in women. We observed no main
associations between Native-American ancestry and adiposity but observed
significant effect-modification of the association with BMI by diet
(p-interaction: <0.003) with inverse associations among participants with higher 
Healthy Eating Scores. No associations were observed between BGA and changes in
adiposity over time.
CONCLUSION: Findings support that West-African ancestry may contribute to high
prevalence of total body adiposity among African-Americans, particularly
African-American women.
