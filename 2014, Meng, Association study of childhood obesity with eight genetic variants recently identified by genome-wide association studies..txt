BACKGROUND: Being overweight or obese is becoming increasingly common in low- and
middle-income countries. The present study aimed to examine association of eight 
genetic variants with obesity and to estimate the cumulative effects of these
variants in Chinese children.
METHODS: We conducted the case-control study in a total of 2,030 subjects.
Genotyping of seven novel variants was performed with matrix-assisted laser
desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry, while rs9939609 was
genotyped with tetra-primer amplification refractory mutation system analysis.
RESULTS: The association of two fat mass and obesity-associated gene (FTO)
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; rs9939609 and rs62048402) with body mass
index (BMI) or obesity reached nominal significance at P < 0.05. We found a
cumulative effect of five SNPs on the risk of overweight and obesity (odds ratio 
(OR) = 1.197, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.068-1.342, P = 0.002). Subjects
carrying 9 or more effect alleles had a 127% increased risk of overweight and
obesity (OR = 2.270, 95% CI = 1.403-3.671, P = 0.001) compared with subjects who 
carry 6 or fewer effect alleles.
CONCLUSION: We confirmed two FTO SNPs (rs62048402 and rs9939609) had nominal
significant effects on BMI or obesity. We identified the cumulative effect of
five SNPs on risk of overweight and obesity. The results provided evidence for
identifying genetic factors related to childhood obesity.
