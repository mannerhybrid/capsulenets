BACKGROUND: In some previous studies direct associations between intake of soft
drinks, sugar-sweetened beverages and adiposity have been reported. The majority 
of these studies were, however, conducted in the USA and it is uncertain if the
results are applicable to non-US countries.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the association between sweet drink intake at age 6 and 9
years and the subsequent 3- to 7-year changes in body mass index (BMI) and sum of
four skin-folds (Σ4SF).
METHODS: Information on sweet drink intake (7 days food record) and physical
activity (accelerometer) was obtained at age 6 years (n = 366) [Correction made
here after initial online publication.] and 9 years (n = 269). Weight, height and
Σ4SF were measured at age 6, 9 and 13 years. Additional information on
socio-economic status, maternal BMI and pubertal status was obtained.
RESULTS: No associations were observed between sweet drink intake at age 6 years 
and change in BMI or logΣ4SF from age 6 to 9 years or 6 to 13 years. Also, no
associations were observed between change in sweet drink intake from age 6 to 9
years and subsequent change in BMI or logΣ4SF from age 9 to 13 years. A weak
direct association was observed between sweet drink intake at age 9 years and
change in logΣ4SF from age 9 to 13 years (per 100 g ∼ 3.38 fl oz) (β: 0.014, 95% 
confidence interval [CI]: -0.001 to 0.029, P = 0.06), while no association was
seen for BMI. In supplementary analyses a similar association was observed for
soft drinks (β: 0.087, 95% CI: 0.048 to 0.126, P = 0.001) but only in the
intervention group.
CONCLUSION: We observed associations between intake of sweet drinks and soft
drinks and change in skin-fold thickness in a group of Danish children. However, 
as the associations did not remain significant when multiple testing was
considered or was only significant among children from the intervention group,
the results do not confirm or refute the direct association reported in previous 
studies.
