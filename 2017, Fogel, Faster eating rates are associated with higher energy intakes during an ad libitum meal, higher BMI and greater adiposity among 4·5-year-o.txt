Faster eating rates are associated with higher energy intakes during an ad
libitum meal, higher BMI and greater adiposity among 4·5-year-old children:

Faster eating rates are associated with increased energy intake, but little is
known about the relationship between children's eating rate, food intake and
adiposity. We examined whether children who eat faster consume more energy and
whether this is associated with higher weight status and adiposity. We
hypothesised that eating rate mediates the relationship between child weight and 
ad libitum energy intake. Children (n 386) from the Growing Up in Singapore
Towards Healthy Outcomes cohort participated in a video-recorded ad libitum lunch
at 4·5 years to measure acute energy intake. Videos were coded for three
eating-behaviours (bites, chews and swallows) to derive a measure of eating rate 
(g/min). BMI and anthropometric indices of adiposity were measured. A subset of
children underwent MRI scanning (n 153) to measure abdominal subcutaneous and
visceral adiposity. Children above/below the median eating rate were categorised 
as slower and faster eaters, and compared across body composition measures. There
was a strong positive relationship between eating rate and energy intake (r 0·61,
P<0·001) and a positive linear relationship between eating rate and children's
BMI status. Faster eaters consumed 75 % more energy content than slower eating
children (Δ548 kJ (Δ131 kcal); 95 % CI 107·6, 154·4, P<0·001), and had higher
whole-body (P<0·05) and subcutaneous abdominal adiposity (Δ118·3 cc; 95 % CI
24·0, 212·7, P=0·014). Mediation analysis showed that eating rate mediates the
link between child weight and energy intake during a meal (b 13·59; 95 % CI 7·48,
21·83). Children who ate faster had higher energy intake, and this was associated
with increased BMI z-score and adiposity.
