BACKGROUND: Excess adiposity in childhood is associated with numerous adverse
health outcomes. As this condition is difficult to treat once present,
identification of risk early in life can help inform and implement strategies to 
prevent the onset of the condition. We performed an epigenome-wide association
study to prospectively investigate the relationship between cord blood DNA
methylation and adiposity measurements in childhood.
METHODS: We measured genome-wide DNA methylation from 478 children in cord blood 
and measured overall and central adiposity via skinfold caliper measurements in
early (range 3.1-3.3 years) and mid-childhood (age range 7.3-8.3 years) and via
dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) in mid-childhood. Final models were adjusted for 
maternal age at enrollment, pre-pregnancy body mass index, education, folate
intake during pregnancy, smoking during pregnancy, and gestational weight gain,
and child sex, race/ethnicity, current age, and cord blood cell composition.
RESULTS: We identified four promoter proximal CpG sites that were associated with
adiposity as measured by subscapular (SS) and triceps (TR) ratio (SS:TR) in early
childhood, in the genes KPRP, SCL9A10, MYLK2, and PRLHR. We additionally
identified one gene body CpG site associated with early childhood SS + TR on
PPAPDC1A; this site was nominally associated with SS + TR in mid-childhood.
Higher methylation at one promoter proximal CpG site in MMP25 was also associated
with SS:TR in mid-childhood. In regional analyses, methylation at an exonal
region of GFPT2 was positively associated with SS:TR in early childhood. Finally,
we identified regions of two long, non-coding RNAs which were associated with
SS:TR (LOC100049716) and fat-free mass index (LOC102723493) in mid-childhood.
CONCLUSION: This analysis identified novel CpG loci associated with adiposity
outcomes. However, our results suggest little consistency across the various
adiposity outcomes tested, particularly among the more accurate DXA measurements 
of body composition. We recommend using caution when interpreting these
associations.
