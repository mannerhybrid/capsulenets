Recent genetic studies have identified some alleles that are associated with
higher BMI but lower risk of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease.
These "favorable adiposity" alleles are collectively associated with lower
insulin levels and higher subcutaneous-to-visceral adipose tissue ratio and may
protect from disease through higher adipose storage capacity. We aimed to use
data from 164,609 individuals from the UK Biobank and five other studies to
replicate associations between a genetic score of 11 favorable adiposity variants
and adiposity and risk of disease, to test for interactions between BMI and
favorable adiposity genetics, and to test effects separately in men and women. In
the UK Biobank, the 50% of individuals carrying the most favorable adiposity
alleles had higher BMIs (0.120 kg/m(2) [95% CI 0.066, 0.174]; P = 1E-5) and
higher body fat percentage (0.301% [0.230, 0.372]; P = 1E-16) compared with the
50% of individuals carrying the fewest alleles. For a given BMI, the 50% of
individuals carrying the most favorable adiposity alleles were at lower risk of
type 2 diabetes (odds ratio [OR] 0.837 [0.784, 0.894]; P = 1E-7), hypertension
(OR 0.935 [0.911, 0.958]; P = 1E-7), and heart disease (OR 0.921 [0.872, 0.973]; 
P = 0.003) and had lower blood pressure (systolic -0.859 mmHg [-1.099, -0.618]; P
= 3E-12 and diastolic -0.394 mmHg [-0.534, -0.254]; P = 4E-8). In women, these
associations could be explained by the observation that the alleles associated
with higher BMI but lower risk of disease were also associated with a favorable
body fat distribution, with a lower waist-to-hip ratio (-0.004 cm [95% CI -0.005,
-0.003] 50% vs. 50%; P = 3E-14), but in men, the favorable adiposity alleles were
associated with higher waist circumference (0.454 cm [0.267, 0.641] 50% vs. 50%; 
P = 2E-6) and higher waist-to-hip ratio (0.0013 [0.0003, 0.0024] 50% vs. 50%; P =
0.01). Results were strengthened when a meta-analysis with five additional
studies was conducted. There was no evidence of interaction between a genetic
score consisting of known BMI variants and the favorable adiposity genetic score.
In conclusion, different molecular mechanisms that lead to higher body fat
percentage (with greater subcutaneous storage capacity) can have different
impacts on cardiometabolic disease risk. Although higher BMI is associated with
higher risk of diseases, better fat storage capacity could reduce the risk.
