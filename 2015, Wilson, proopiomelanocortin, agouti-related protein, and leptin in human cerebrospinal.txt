Leptin and its neuronal targets, which produce proopiomelanocortin (POMC) and
agouti-related protein (AgRP), regulate energy balance. This study characterized 
leptin, POMC, and AgRP in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 47 healthy human
subjects, 23 lean and 24 overweight/obese (OW/OB), as related to BMI, adiposity, 
plasma leptin, soluble leptin receptor (s-OB-R), and insulin. POMC was measured
since the POMC prohormone is the predominant POMC peptide in CSF and correlates
with hypothalamic POMC in rodents. Plasma AgRP was similarly characterized. CSF
leptin was 83-fold lower than in plasma and correlated strongly with BMI, body
fat, and insulin. The relative amount of leptin transported into CSF declined
with increasing BMI, ranging from 4.5 to 0.52%, consistent with a saturable
transport mechanism. CSF sOB-R was 78-fold lower than in plasma and correlated
negatively with plasma and CSF leptin. CSF POMC was higher in lean vs. OW/OB
subjects (P < 0.001) and correlated negatively with CSF leptin (r = -0.60, P <
0.001) and with plasma leptin, insulin, BMI, and adiposity. CSF AgRP was not
different in lean vs. OW/OB; however, plasma AgRP was higher in lean subjects (P 
= 0.001) and correlated negatively with BMI, adiposity, leptin, insulin, and HOMA
(P < 0.005). Thus, CSF measurements may provide useful biomarkers for brain
leptin and POMC activity. The striking negative correlation between CSF leptin
and POMC could be secondary to leptin resistance and/or neuronal changes
associated with obesity but may also indicate that POMC plays a primary role in
regulating body weight and adiposity. The role of plasma AgRP as a neuroendocrine
biomarker deserves further study.
