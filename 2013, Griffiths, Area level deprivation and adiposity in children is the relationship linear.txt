OBJECTIVE: It has been suggested that childhood obesity is inversely associated
with deprivation, such that the prevalence is higher in more deprived groups.
However, comparatively few studies actually use an area-level measure of
deprivation, limiting the scope to assess trends in the association with obesity 
for this indicator. Furthermore, most assume a linear relationship. Therefore,
the aim of this study was to investigate associations between area-level
deprivation and three measures of adiposity in children: body mass index (BMI),
waist circumference (WC) and waist-to-height ratio (WHtR).
DESIGN: This is a cross-sectional study in which data were collected on three
occasions a year apart (2005-2007).
SUBJECTS: Data were available for 13,333 children, typically aged 11-12 years,
from 37 schools and 542 lower super-output areas (LSOAs).
MEASURES: Stature, mass and WC. Obesity was defined as a BMI and WC exceeding the
95th centile according to British reference data. WHtR exceeding 0.5 defined
obesity. The Index of Multiple Deprivation affecting children (IDACI) was used to
determine area-level deprivation.
RESULTS: Considerable differences in the prevalence of obesity exist between the 
three different measures. However, for all measures of adiposity the highest
probability of being classified as obese is in the middle of the IDACI range.
This relationship is more marked in girls, such that the probability of being
obese for girls living in areas at the two extremes of deprivation is around half
that at the peak, occurring in the middle.
CONCLUSION: These data confirm the high prevalence of obesity in children and
suggest that the relationship between obesity and residential area-level
deprivation is not linear. This is contrary to the 'deprivation theory' and
questions the current understanding and interpretation of the relationship
between obesity and deprivation in children. These results could help make
informed decisions at the local level.
