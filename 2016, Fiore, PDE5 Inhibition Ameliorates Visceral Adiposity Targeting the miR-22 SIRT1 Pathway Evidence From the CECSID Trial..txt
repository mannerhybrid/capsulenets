CONTEXT: Visceral adiposity plays a significant role in cardiovascular risk. PDE5
inhibitors (PDE5i) can improve cardiac function and insulin sensitivity in type 2
diabetes patients.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether PDE5i affect visceral adipose tissue (VAT),
specifically epicardial fat (epicardial adipose tissue [EAT]), and what mechanism
is involved, using microarray-based profiling of pharmacologically modulated
microRNA (miRNAs).
DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in type 2 diabetes.
PATIENTS AND INTERVENTION: A total of 59 diabetic patients were randomized to
receive 100-mg/d sildenafil or placebo for 12 weeks. Fat biopsies were collected 
in a subgroup of patients. In a parallel protocol, db/db mice were randomized to 
12 weeks of sildenafil or vehicle, and VAT was collected.
MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES: Anthropometric and metabolic parameters, EAT
quantification through cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, array of 2005
circulating miRNAs, quantitative PCR, and flow cytometry of VAT.
RESULTS: Compared with placebo, sildenafil reduced waist circumference (P = .024)
and EAT (P = .045). Microarray analysis identified some miRNAs differentially
regulated by sildenafil, including down-regulation of miR-22-3p, confirmed by
real-time quantitative PCR (P < .001). Sildenafil's modulation of miR-22-3p
expression was confirmed in vitro in HL1 cardiomyocytes. Up-regulation of SIRT1, 
a known target of miR-22-3p, was found in both serum and sc fat in
sildenafil-treated subjects. Compared with vehicle, 12-week sildenafil treatment 
down-regulated miR-22-3p and up-regulated Sirtuin1 (SIRT1) gene expression in VAT
from db/db mice, shifting adipose tissue cell composition toward a less inflamed 
profile.
CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with PDE5i in humans and murine models of diabetes
improves VAT, targeting SIRT1 through a modulation of miR-22-3p expression.
