Metabolomic markers associated with incident central adiposity gain were
investigated in young adults. In a 9-mo prospective study of university freshmen 
(n = 264). Blood samples and anthropometry measurements were collected in the
first 3 d on campus and at the end of the year. Plasma from individuals was
pooled by phenotype [incident central adiposity, stable adiposity, baseline
hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) > 5.05%, HbA1c < 4.92%] and assayed using GC-MS,
chromatograms were analyzed using MetaboliteDetector software, and normalized
metabolite levels were compared using Welch's t test. Assays were repeated using 
freshly prepared pools, and statistically significant metabolites were quantified
in a targeted GC-MS approach. Isotope tracer studies were performed to determine 
if the potential marker was an endogenous human metabolite in men and in whole
blood. Participants with incident central adiposity gain had statistically
significantly higher blood erythritol [P < 0.001, false discovery rate (FDR) =
0.0435], and the targeted assay revealed 15-fold [95% confidence interval (CI):
13.27, 16.25] higher blood erythritol compared with participants with stable
adiposity. Participants with baseline HbA1c > 5.05% had 21-fold (95% CI: 19.84,
21.41) higher blood erythritol compared with participants with lower HbA1c (P <
0.001, FDR = 0.00016). Erythritol was shown to be synthesized endogenously from
glucose via the pentose-phosphate pathway (PPP) in stable isotope-assisted ex
vivo blood incubation experiments and through in vivo conversion of erythritol to
erythronate in stable isotope-assisted dried blood spot experiments. Therefore,
endogenous production of erythritol from glucose may contribute to the
association between erythritol and obesity observed in young adults.
