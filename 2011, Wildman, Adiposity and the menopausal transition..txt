This review summarizes the published literature on the potentially circular
relationship between adiposity and the menopause. Although data are limited,
current information suggests there are substantial effects of obesity and
adiposity on the magnitude of hormone changes experienced during the transition, 
as well as on the risks of chronic disease resulting from the menopause
transition. However, evidence regarding the reverse, namely, effects of the
menopause transition and its associated hormone changes on weight gain and
redistribution of body fat, are inconclusive.
