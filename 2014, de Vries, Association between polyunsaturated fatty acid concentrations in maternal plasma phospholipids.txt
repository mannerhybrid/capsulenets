Prenatal polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) concentrations may be involved in the 
prenatal programming of adiposity. In this study we therefore explored the
association between maternal PUFA concentrations, measured up to four times
during pregnancy, and offspring adiposity at age 7 in 234 mother-child pairs of
the Maastricht Essential Fatty Acid Birth cohort. Only dihomo-gamma-linolenic
acid (DGLA, an n-6 fatty acid) concentration was associated with adiposity: per
standard deviation increase in relative DGLA concentration, BMI increased by
0.44kg/m(2) (CI95: 0.16, 0.72), sum of skinfolds increased by 3.41mm (CI95: 1.88,
4.95), waist circumference increased by 1.09cm (CI95: 0.40, 1.78), and plasma
leptin concentration increased by 0.66µg/l (CI95: 0.20, 1.11). In conclusion,
maternal DGLA throughout gestation was associated with increased BMI and some
additional measures of adiposity at age 7. This suggests that maternal DGLA might
play a role in or reflect the prenatal programming of adiposity.
