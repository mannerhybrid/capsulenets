OBJECTIVES: Several important research questions have been addressed: (1) What
are the cross-sectional associations between sports club participation,
objectively measured physical activity, and adiposity? (2) Do measures of
physical activity and adiposity predict subsequent sports club participation? (3)
Does sports club participation predict subsequent measures of physical activity
and adiposity? and (4) Do changes in sports club participation predict changes in
objective measures of physical activity and adiposity?
DESIGN: Longitudinal and cross-sectional.
METHODS: Data from the Gateshead Millennium Study birth cohort (n=609 at age 7
years) were analysed for associations between adiposity, sports club
participation and accelerometer-measured physical activity from ages 7y to 9y to 
12y.
RESULTS: Seventy-two per cent of 9 year olds and 63% of 12 year olds took part in
a sports club. Sports club participation was significantly associated with
overall accelerometer-measured physical activity at 12y (coefficient=0.0.09; 95% 
CI: 0.01-0.16) but not 9y. An inverse relationship between fat mass (estimated
from bioelectric impedance) and sport club participation, and between fat mass
and accelerometer-measured physical activity was observed at 12y, but not 9y.
Sports club participation at 9y was highly predictive of participation at 12y.
Sports club participation was significantly associated with socioeconomic status;
fewer children from poorer areas took part.
CONCLUSIONS: Sports club participation in adolescence may be associated with
decreased levels of adiposity. Furthermore, the potential benefits of sports club
participation for adiposity are likely generated from continuous participation in
sports, rather than any long-term protective effects.
