BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Stress is associated with gains in adiposity. One
factor that determines how much stress is experienced is how quickly an
adolescent reduces responding (habituates) across repeated stressors. The purpose
of this study was to determine the association of body mass index (BMI)
percentile and the rate of habituation to a stressor.
DESIGN: Thirty-four adolescents completed anthropometric measures and a
habituation protocol using a within study design.
METHODS: The habituation protocol measured the rate of decline in perceived
stress and heart rate (HR) across four, two-minute serial subtraction trials.
RESULTS: Multivariate linear regression revealed the habituation rate of the HR
predicted BMI percentile after adjusting for gender, socioeconomic status, and
initial HR (β = 17.2, p < .04).
CONCLUSIONS: Slower habituation to a laboratory stressor was associated with
greater BMI percentiles in adolescents.
