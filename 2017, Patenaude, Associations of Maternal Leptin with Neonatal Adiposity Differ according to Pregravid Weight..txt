BACKGROUND: During pregnancy, maternal circulating leptin is released by maternal
adipose tissue and the placenta, and may have a role in fetal development.
OBJECTIVES: We investigated maternal leptinemia and glycemia associations with
neonatal adiposity, taking into account pregravid weight status.
METHODS: We included 235 pregnant women from the Genetics of Glucose Regulation
in Gestation and Growth prospective cohort with data: blood samples collected
during the 2nd trimester, an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), and the measured
leptin and glucose levels. As an integrated measure of maternal leptin exposure, 
we calculated the area under the curve for maternal leptin at the OGTT
(AUCleptin). Within 72 h of delivery, we measured the triceps, biceps,
subscapular, and suprailiac skinfold thicknesses (SFTs); the sum of these SFTs
represented neonatal adiposity. We conducted a regression analysis to assess the 
maternal metabolic determinants of neonatal adiposity, adjusting for parity,
smoking status, maternal triglyceride levels, gestational weight gain, placental 
weight, delivery mode, neonate sex, and gestational age at delivery.
RESULTS: The pregravid BMI of the participating women was 23.3 (21.2-27.0). In
the 2nd trimester, maternal AUCleptin was 1,292.0 (767.0-2,222.5) (ng × min)/mL, 
and fasting glucose levels were 4.2 ± 0.4 mmol/L. At delivery, the neonatal sum
of 4 SFTs was 17.9 ± 3.3 mm. Higher maternal leptinemia was associated with
higher neonatal adiposity (β = 4.23 mm [SE = 1.77] per log-AUCleptin; p = 0.02)
in mothers with a BMI ≥25, independently of confounders and maternal glycemia,
but not in mothers with a BMI <25. Higher maternal fasting glucose was associated
with higher neonatal adiposity (β = 0.88 mm [SE = 0.30] per SD glucose; p =
0.005) in mothers with a BMI <25, independently of confounders and maternal
leptinemia.
CONCLUSION: Maternal leptinemia may be associated with neonatal adiposity in
offspring from overweight/obese mothers, independently of maternal glycemia.
