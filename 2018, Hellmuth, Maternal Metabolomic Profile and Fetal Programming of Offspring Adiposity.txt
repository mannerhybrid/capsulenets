SCOPE: The fetal programming paradigm posits that the origins of obesity can be
traced, in part, to the intrauterine period of life. However, the mechanisms
underlying fetal programming are not well understood, and few studies have
measured offspring adiposity in the neonatal period. The aim of this study was to
identify maternal metabolites, and their determinants, that are associated with
neonatal adiposity.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We applied a targeted metabolomics approach to analyze
plasma samples collected across gestation from a well-characterized cohort of 253
pregnant women participating in a prospective study at the University of
California, Irvine. Whole-body Dual X-Ray Absorptiometry (DXA) imaging of body
composition was obtained in N = 121 newborns. Statistical models were adjusted
for potential confounders and multiple testing. We identified six alkyl-linked
phosphatidylcholines (PCae), containing fatty acid 20:4, that were significantly 
and negatively associated with neonatal body fat percentage. Factors indicating
higher socioeconomic status, non-Hispanic ethnicity and higher non-esterified
fatty acid percentages were positively associated with these PCae.
CONCLUSIONS: The polyunsaturated fatty acid 20:4 contained in PCae may exert a
beneficial effect with respect to future propensity for obesity development. Pre-
and early-pregnancy factors are determinants of these PCae, highlighting the
importance of addressing pre-conceptional conditions for fetal programming of
newborn adiposity. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
