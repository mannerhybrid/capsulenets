OBJECTIVE: Taken in isolation, depression, anxiety, and hostility/anger have been
shown to predict obesity. It is unknown whether these negative emotional factors 
are associated with adiposity, independently of each other. The objective of this
review was to determine whether negative emotional factors have independent
associations with adiposity.
METHODS: We searched for observational studies examining adiposity and two or
more negative emotional factors. Studies which examined a negative emotional
factor using analyses which controlled for other emotional factor(s) were
selected for the review.
RESULTS: Three prospective and 11 cross-sectional studies met our
inclusion/exclusion criteria. Of these investigations, 64% indicated that
depression had positive associations with adiposity, independent of anxiety or
hostility, and 56% indicated that anxiety had independent associations with
adiposity. Only 33% of studies found independent associations for hostility and
adiposity; however, far fewer studies were available.
CONCLUSION: Depression and anxiety have independent associations with excess
adiposity when controlling for other emotional factors. Additional studies are
needed to determine whether hostility/anger is independently associated with
excess adiposity. These results have implications for the design of effective
obesity prevention programs.
