This study investigated the cross-sectional and longitudinal association between 
adenovirus 36 (Ad36) and obesity in 79 Korean adolescent boys over 1 year. We
analyzed the changes in body composition and metabolic risk factors according to 
the presence of Ad36 antibodies. Ad36 antibodies in serum were detected using the
constant virus-decreasing serum method. We found that the fat percentage and
fasting insulin in the Ad36-seropositive group were greater than the
Ad36-seronegative group. These results suggest that Ad36 infection is associated 
with an increase of adiposity, and the experience of Ad36 infection may affect
the future fat gain of adolescents.
