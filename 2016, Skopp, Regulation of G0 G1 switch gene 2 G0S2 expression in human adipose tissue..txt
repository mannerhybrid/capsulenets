The G0/G1 switch gene 2 (G0S2) protein attenuated adipose triglyceride lipase
(ATGL) activity and decreased lipolysis in rodent and human adipocytes. We
hypothesized that G0S2 mRNA expression in human adipose tissue is influenced by
depot, adipocyte size, body weight and caloric intake. Adipose tissue samples
were obtained during abdominal surgery and by needle biopsy before and 3 h after 
an extended glucose load in lean subjects. G0S2 mRNA was 7× higher expressed in
mature human adipocytes compared to the stromavascular fraction. Cell size
inversely correlated with G0S2 mRNA expression in both, subcutaneous and omental 
adipose depots. G0S2 mRNA expression was 75% higher in subcutaneous compared to
omental adipose tissue. Obesity was associated with lower G0S2 mRNA expression in
subcutaneous adipose tissue. Acute glucose ingestion after an overnight fast did 
not significantly increase G0S2 expression in subcutaneous adipose tissue. In
conclusion, differences in G0S2 expression may explain depot-specific and
obesity-associated differences in lipolysis on the molecular level.
