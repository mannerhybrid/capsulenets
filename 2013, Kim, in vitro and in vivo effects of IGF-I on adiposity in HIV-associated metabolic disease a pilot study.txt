BACKGROUND AND AIMS: We tested the effects of recombinant insulin-like growth
factor-I (IGF-I) in an adipocyte model of HIV lipodystrophy and in an open label 
study on body composition and metabolism in patients with HIV lipodystrophy.
METHODS: The effects of IGF-I on ritonavir-induced adipocyte cell death were
studied in vitro. We assessed lipid accumulation, IGF signaling, apoptosis, and
gene expression. We conducted a 24-week open label trial of recombinant IGF-I in 
ten adults with HIV associated lipoatrophy. Laboratory assessments included
glucose, insulin, lipids, and IGF-I. At weeks 0 and 24, body composition studies 
were performed including skinfold measurement, dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, 
and computed tomography of the abdomen and thigh.
RESULTS: In vitro, ritonavir increased delipidation and apoptosis of adipocytes, 
whereas co-treatment with IGF-I attenuated the effect. In the clinical study,
subcutaneous adipose tissue did not increase in patients after treatment with
IGF-I; however, there was a decrease in the proportion of abdominal fat (39.8 ±
7% vs. 34.6 ± 7%, p = 0.007). IGF-I levels increased with treatment (143 ± 28
μg/L at week 0 vs. 453 ± 212 μg/L at week 24, p = 0.002), whereas IGFBP-3 levels 
declined (3.554 ± 1.146 mg/L vs. 3.235 ± 1.151 mg/L, p = 0.02). Insulin at week
12 decreased significantly (90.1 ± 39.8 pmol/L vs. 33.2 ± 19.6 pmol/L, p =
0.002). There was a nonsignificant decrease in visceral adipose tissue (155.2 ±
68 cm² at week 0 vs. 140.6 ± 70 cm² at week 24, p = 0.08).
CONCLUSIONS: Use of recombinant IGF-I may lower fasting insulin and abdominal fat
in patients with lipoatrophy associated with HIV infection. Further evaluation of
this agent for treatment of HIV-associated lipodystrophy may be warranted.
