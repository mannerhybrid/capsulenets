CONTEXT: The melanocortin-4 receptor gene (MC4R) plays a pivotal role in the
regulation of body fat and food and energy intake.
OBJECTIVES: The objectives of the study were as follows: 1) to evaluate the
association of variants rs17782313 and rs17700633 near the coding region of MC4R 
and 2) to evaluate the association of the transcript levels of MC4R with
adiposity indices and percentage of energy from fat, carbohydrates, and protein
in children.
DESIGN: The Identification and Prevention of Dietary- and Lifestyle-Induced
Health Effects in Children and Infants (IDEFICS) cohort was used, with
examinations at baseline (T0) and after 2 years (T1).
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A total of 16 228 schoolchildren (2-9 y) from eight
European countries participated in the study. A random sample of 4381 children
genotyped for MC4R variants and a subsample of 410 children with MC4R expression 
data in peripheral blood cells (PBCs) were included in the analyses.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Anthropometric measures and energy intake (total and from 
fat, carbohydrates, and protein) served as outcomes for adiposity status and for 
dietary behavior, respectively.
RESULTS: At T0, the C allele of rs17782313 (minor frequency allele 23%) was
significantly associated with higher values of adiposity indices (all P < .001). 
No association was found between rs17700633 (minor frequency allele 28%) and the 
variables under study. At T1, the C allele of rs17782313 was associated with a
significantly higher increase in the adiposity indices over time (all P < .05).
The MC4R expression levels in PBCs were inversely associated with body fat and
energy intake from carbohydrates and directly with energy from fat (all P ≤ .05) 
but were not influenced by variants rs17782313 and rs17700633.
CONCLUSIONS: The common variant rs17782313 near MC4R was cross-sectionally and
longitudinally associated with body mass index and measures of body fatness in
children aged 2-9 years. We showed, for the first time in humans, that MC4R
expression levels in PBCs are related to body fat distribution and percentage of 
energy intake from carbohydrates and fat.
