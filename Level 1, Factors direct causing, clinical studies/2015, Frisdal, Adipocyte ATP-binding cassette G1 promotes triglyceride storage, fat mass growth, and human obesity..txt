The role of the ATP-binding cassette G1 (ABCG1) transporter in human
pathophysiology is still largely unknown. Indeed, beyond its role in mediating
free cholesterol efflux to HDL, the ABCG1 transporter equally promotes lipid
accumulation in a triglyceride (TG)-rich environment through regulation of the
bioavailability of lipoprotein lipase (LPL). Because both ABCG1 and LPL are
expressed in adipose tissue, we hypothesized that ABCG1 is implicated in
adipocyte TG storage and therefore could be a major actor in adipose tissue fat
accumulation. Silencing of Abcg1 expression by RNA interference in 3T3-L1
preadipocytes compromised LPL-dependent TG accumulation during the initial phase 
of differentiation. Generation of stable Abcg1 knockdown 3T3-L1 adipocytes
revealed that Abcg1 deficiency reduces TG storage and diminishes lipid droplet
size through inhibition of Pparγ expression. Strikingly, local inhibition of
adipocyte Abcg1 in adipose tissue from mice fed a high-fat diet led to a rapid
decrease of adiposity and weight gain. Analysis of two frequent ABCG1 single
nucleotide polymorphisms (rs1893590 [A/C] and rs1378577 [T/G]) in morbidly obese 
individuals indicated that elevated ABCG1 expression in adipose tissue was
associated with increased PPARγ expression and adiposity concomitant to increased
fat mass and BMI (haplotype AT>GC). The critical role of ABCG1 in obesity was
further confirmed in independent populations of severe obese and diabetic obese
individuals. This study identifies for the first time a major role of adipocyte
ABCG1 in adiposity and fat mass growth and suggests that adipose ABCG1 might
represent a potential therapeutic target in obesity.
