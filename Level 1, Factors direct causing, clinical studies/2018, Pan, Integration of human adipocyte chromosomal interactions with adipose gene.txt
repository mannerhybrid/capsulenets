Increased adiposity is a hallmark of obesity and overweight, which affect 2.2
billion people world-wide. Understanding the genetic and molecular mechanisms
that underlie obesity-related phenotypes can help to improve treatment options
and drug development. Here we perform promoter Capture Hi-C in human adipocytes
to investigate interactions between gene promoters and distal elements as a
transcription-regulating mechanism contributing to these phenotypes. We find that
promoter-interacting elements in human adipocytes are enriched for
adipose-related transcription factor motifs, such as PPARG and CEBPB, and
contribute to heritability of cis-regulated gene expression. We further intersect
these data with published genome-wide association studies for BMI and BMI-related
metabolic traits to identify the genes that are under genetic cis regulation in
human adipocytes via chromosomal interactions. This integrative genomics approach
identifies four cis-eQTL-eGene relationships associated with BMI or
obesity-related traits, including rs4776984 and MAP2K5, which we further confirm 
by EMSA, and highlights 38 additional candidate genes.
