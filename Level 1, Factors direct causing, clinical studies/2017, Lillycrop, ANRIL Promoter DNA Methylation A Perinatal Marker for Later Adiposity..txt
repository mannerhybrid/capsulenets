Experimental studies show a substantial contribution of early life environment to
obesity risk through epigenetic processes. We examined inter-individual DNA
methylation differences in human birth tissues associated with child's adiposity.
We identified a novel association between the level of CpG methylation at birth
within the promoter of the long non-coding RNA ANRIL (encoded at CDKN2A) and
childhood adiposity at age 6-years. An association between ANRIL methylation and 
adiposity was also observed in three additional populations; in birth tissues
from ethnically diverse neonates, in peripheral blood from adolescents, and in
adipose tissue from adults. Additionally, CpG methylation was associated with
ANRIL expression in vivo, and CpG mutagenesis in vitro inhibited ANRIL promoter
activity. Furthermore, CpG methylation enhanced binding to an Estrogen Response
Element within the ANRIL promoter. Our findings demonstrate that perinatal
methylation at loci relevant to gene function may be a robust marker of later
adiposity, providing substantial support for epigenetic processes in mediating
long-term consequences of early life environment on human health.
