CONTEXT: Sex hormones may influence adipose tissue deposition, possibly
contributing to sex disparities in cardiovascular disease risk.
OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that associations of sex hormone levels with visceral 
and subcutaneous fat differ by sex.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Participants were from the Multi-Ethnic Study 
of Atherosclerosis with sex hormone levels at baseline and visceral and
subcutaneous fat measurements from computed tomography at visit 2 or 3 (n =
1835).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Multivariable linear regression was used to investigate
the relationships between sex hormones and adiposity. Testing for interaction by 
sex, race/ethnicity, and age was conducted.
RESULTS: In adjusted models, there was a modest significant positive association 
between estradiol and visceral fat in both sexes (percent difference in visceral 
fat for 1% difference in hormone [95% confidence interval] in women, 5.44 [1.82, 
9.09]; and in men, 8.22 [0.61, 16.18]). Higher bioavailable T was significantly
associated with higher visceral and subcutaneous fat in women and with the
reverse in men (women, 14.38 [10.23, 18.69]; men, -7.69 [-13.06, -1.00]). Higher 
dehydroepiandrosterone was associated with higher visceral fat in women (7.57
[1.71, 13.88]), but not in men (-2.47 [-8.88, 4.29]). Higher SHBG was associated 
with significantly lower levels of adiposity in both sexes (women, -24.42
[-28.11, -20.55]; men, -27.39 [-32.97, -21.34]). There was no significant
interaction by race/ethnicity or age.
CONCLUSION: Sex hormones are significantly associated with adiposity, and the
associations of androgens differ qualitatively by sex. This heterogeneity may
help explain the complexity of the contribution of sex hormones to sex
differences in cardiovascular disease.
