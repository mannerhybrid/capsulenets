OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether increments of weight gain in early infancy are 
related to the timing of adiposity rebound (AR).
STUDY DESIGN: A total of 271 children (147 boys and 124 girls) in 1 community
were enrolled in the study. Serial measurements of body mass index were carried
out at the ages of 4, 8, and 12 months and 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10
years, based on which the age of AR was determined. We also calculated body
weight increments in 3 separate periods: birth to 4 months, 4-8 months, and 8-12 
months.
RESULTS: There was no significant relationship between weight gain in any period 
of infancy and the age of AR. Weight gain between birth and 4 months was
positively correlated only with body mass index at 7 years of age.
CONCLUSIONS: We could not find an association between body weight gain during
infancy and the timing of AR. This suggests that infantile weight gain is not
related to childhood obesity through AR.
