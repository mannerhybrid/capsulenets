BACKGROUND: Biotin acts as a coenzyme for carboxylases regulating lipid and
amino-acid metabolism. We investigated alterations of the biotin-dependent
functions in obesity and the downstream effects of biotin restriction in
adipocytes in vitro.
SUBJECTS: Twenty-four monozygotic twin pairs discordant for body mass index
(BMI). Mean within-pair difference (heavy-lean co-twin, Δ) of BMI was
6.0 kg m(-2) (range 3.1-15.2 kg m(-)(2)).
METHODS: Adipose tissue (AT) DNA methylation, gene expression of AT and
adipocytes, and leukocytes (real-time quantitative PCR), serum biotin, C-reactive
protein (CRP) and triglycerides were measured in the twins. Human adipocytes were
cultured in low and control biotin concentrations and analyzed for lipid droplet 
content, mitochondrial morphology and mitochondrial respiration.
RESULTS: The gene expression levels of carboxylases, PCCB and MCCC1, were
upregulated in the heavier co-twins' leukocytes. ΔPCCB (r=0.91, P=0.0046) and
ΔMCCC1 (r=0.79, P=0.036) correlated with ΔCRP within-pairs. Serum biotin levels
were lower in the heavier (274 ng l(-1)) than in the lean co-twins (390 ng l(-1),
P=0.034). ΔBiotin correlated negatively with Δtriglycerides (r=-0.56, P=0.045)
within-pairs. In AT, HLCS and ACACB were hypermethylated and biotin cycle genes
HLCS and BTD were downregulated (P<0.05). Biotin-dependent carboxylases were
downregulated (ACACA, ACACB, PCCB, MCCC2 and PC; P<0.05) in both AT and
adipocytes of the heavier co-twins. Adipocytes cultured in low biotin had
decreased lipid accumulation, altered mitochondrial morphology and deficient
mitochondrial respiration.
CONCLUSIONS: Biotin-dependent functions are modified by adiposity independent of 
genetic effects, and correlate with inflammation and hypertriglyceridemia. Biotin
restriction decreases lipid accumulation and respiration, and alters
mitochondrial morphology in adipocytes.
