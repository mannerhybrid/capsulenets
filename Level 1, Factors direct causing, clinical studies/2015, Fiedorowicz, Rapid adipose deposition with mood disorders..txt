BACKGROUND: Persons with bipolar disorder represent a high-risk group for
obesity, but little is known about the time course by which weight gain occurs in
bipolar disorder.
METHODS: We prospectively studied changes in fat distribution using dual-energy
x-ray absorptiometry in relationship to medication exposure and mood symptom
burden in 36 participants with bipolar disorder. We assessed the relationship
between prior medication exposure and course of illness with adiposity measures
at baseline (N = 36) and at 6-month follow-up (N = 22).
RESULTS: At baseline, greater adiposity was associated with advanced age and
female sex, not retrospectively assessed symptom course or medication exposure
(past 2 years). Over 6 months of prospective follow-up, participants developed
greater adiposity (fat mass index +0.82 kg/m(²), P = .007; visceral fat area +8.6
cm(²), P = .02; total percent fat +1.6%, P = .02). Manic symptomatology, not
antipsychotic exposure, was related to the increased adiposity.
CONCLUSIONS: Acute exacerbations of mood disorders appear to represent high-risk 
periods for adipose deposition. Obesity prevention efforts may be necessary
during acute exacerbations.
