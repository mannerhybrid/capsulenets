AIM: In euthyroidism, higher TSH levels are weakly associated with increased BMI.
Furthermore, a considerable number of patients complain of weight gain during
thyroid hormone replacement after thyroidectomy. We therefore investigated the
association between levothyroxine medication and BMI in a large cross-sectional
study group.
METHODS: We included euthyroid participants from the MeSyBePo study group (TSH
between 0.3 and 4.5 μU/ml) that did not take thyreostatic drugs. Linear
regression analyses were performed to address the association between
levothyroxine medication and obesity. Additionally, pairs matched by sex, age and
TSH but discordant in levothyroxine medication were compared.
RESULTS: 1663 subjects (569 males) were eligible for inclusion. 151 participants 
were taking levothyroxine. Adjusted for sex and age both TSH (standardised beta
0.1, p<0.001) and levothyroxine medication (standardised beta 0.05, p=0.03) were 
significantly associated with BMI. There was no significant interaction between
TSH and levothyroxine medication with respect to BMI. Further adjustment for
smoking and the restriction to those subjects with normal glucose metabolism (947
participants (314 males, 82 on levothyroxine medication) did not alter the
result. In matched pair analysis (133 pairs), BMI was significantly increased in 
subjects taking levothyroxine compared to controls.
CONCLUSION: Independently from TSH, levothyroxine medication was associated with 
a higher BMI. The mechanisms, however, responsible for this association need to
be elucidated.
