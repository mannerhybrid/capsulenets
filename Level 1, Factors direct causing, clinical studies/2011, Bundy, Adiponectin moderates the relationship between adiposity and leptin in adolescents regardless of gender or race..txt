OBJECTIVES: To determine gender or race differences in associations between
adiposity and leptin, and whether adiponectin moderates these relationships.
METHODS: Subjects were 441 adolescents, 14-18 years old (44% black, 56% white;
50% female, 50% male). Percent body fat (%BF) was measured with dual-energy X-ray
absorptiometry. Leptin and adiponectin were measured using immunoassays.
RESULTS: Among the four groups (white boys, white girls, black boys and black
girls), white girls had the highest adiponectin (p = 0.0017) and black girls had 
the highest leptin (p = 0.0164). Percent BF and leptin were positively correlated
(p = 0.0164). The %BF-leptin relationship was stronger in boys than girls (p <
0.0001). Those with lower adiponectin had a stronger %BF-leptin relationship than
those with high adiponectin in the entire sample (p = 0.0220). Statistical models
were adjusted for age, race, gender and the interaction between race and gender.
CONCLUSION: Our data suggest a protective metabolic interaction for adiponectin
and lend additional support for obesity prevention strategies in adolescents.
