OBJECTIVES: This study considered the association between sexual maturation and
adiposity in children and adolescents, and examined the contribution of sexual
maturation to ethnic differences in total and depot-specific body fat.
METHODS: The sample included 382 White and African American 5-18-year-olds. Body 
mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC) and sexual maturity status
(breast/genital and pubic hair stage) were assessed in a clinical setting. Total 
body fat (TBF) was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and abdominal
subcutaneous (SAT) and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) were measured by magnetic
resonance imaging. Analysis of covariance adjusted for age was used to examine
the association between sexual maturity status and adiposity, and linear
regression adjusted for age was used to examine the influence of sexual
maturation on ethnic differences in adiposity. Analysis of VAT also controlled
for TBF. Significance was accepted at P < 0.05.
RESULTS: Breast/genital stage was significantly associated with BMI, WC, TBF, and
SAT in girls of both ethnic groups and in White boys. Breast stage was associated
with VAT. Stage of pubic hair was significantly associated with TBF and VAT in
White girls only. In girls, sexual maturation attenuated the ethnic effects on
BMI and WC, but the ethnic effect in VAT persisted. In boys, sexual maturation
did not attenuate ethnic differences on VAT and did not predict WC or SAT. Sexual
maturity status independently explained variance in adiposity in girls only.
CONCLUSIONS: Sexual maturity status is an important determinant of pediatric
adiposity and attenuates ethnic differences in girls' adiposity.
