SCOPE: The enzyme nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT) is a major
methyltransferase in adipose tissue. We hypothesized an epigenetic signature in
association with NNMT gene expression in adipose tissue.
METHODS AND RESULTS: The global human methylome was analyzed in visceral adipose 
tissue (VAT) from morbidly obese patients using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 
BeadChip array (discovery cohort: n  =  11). The findings were confirmed in two
additional independent cohorts (Cohort 1: n  =  60; BMI 20-60 kg/m2 and cohort 2:
n  =  40; BMI >40 kg/m2 ) and validated after weight loss (using microarray
data). Among the genes associated with the largest methylation fold change were
genes related to metabolic processes, proliferation, inflammation, and
extracellular matrix remodeling, such as COL23A1, PLEC1, FBXO21, STEAP3, RGS12,
IGDCC3, FOXK2, and ORAI2. In fact, the results showed 577 differentially
methylated CpG sites (DMCpGs) associated with the NNMT expression levels, with
low methylation levels paralleling high NNMT expression. The expression of FBXO21
and FOXK2 was specifically modified after weight loss concomitantly with a
decrease in NNMT expression and inflammation-related genes. Interestingly, the
adipose tissue NNMT gene expression correlated with markers of adipose tissue
inflammation.
CONCLUSIONS: The expression of NNMT in VAT is associated with a specific
methylome signature involving genes linked to adipose tissue metabolic
pathophysiology. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
