Two groups of beneficial bacteria are dominant in the human gut, the
Bacteroidetes and the Firmicutes. Here we show that the relative proportion of
Bacteroidetes is decreased in obese people by comparison with lean people, and
that this proportion increases with weight loss on two types of low-calorie diet.
Our findings indicate that obesity has a microbial component, which might have
potential therapeutic implications.
