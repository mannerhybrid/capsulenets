BACKGROUND: Sleep duration, sedentary behaviour, and physical activity are three 
co-dependent behaviours that fall on the movement/non-movement intensity
continuum. Compositional data analyses provide an appropriate method for
analyzing the association between co-dependent movement behaviour data and health
indicators. The objectives of this study were to examine: (1) the combined
associations of the composition of time spent in sleep, sedentary behaviour,
light-intensity physical activity (LPA), and moderate- to vigorous-intensity
physical activity (MVPA) with adiposity indicators; and (2) the association of
the time spent in sleep, sedentary behaviour, LPA, or MVPA with adiposity
indicators relative to the time spent in the other behaviours in a representative
sample of Canadian preschool-aged children.
METHODS: Participants were 552 children aged 3 to 4 years from cycles 2 and 3 of 
the Canadian Health Measures Survey. Sedentary time, LPA, and MVPA were measured 
with Actical accelerometers (Philips Respironics, Bend, OR USA), and sleep
duration was parental reported. Adiposity indicators included waist circumference
(WC) and body mass index (BMI) z-scores based on World Health Organization growth
standards. Compositional data analyses were used to examine the cross-sectional
associations.
RESULTS: The composition of movement behaviours was significantly associated with
BMI z-scores (p = 0.006) but not with WC (p = 0.718). Further, the time spent in 
sleep (BMI z-score: γ sleep  = -0.72; p = 0.138; WC: γ sleep  = -1.95;
p = 0.285), sedentary behaviour (BMI z-score: γ SB  = 0.19; p = 0.624; WC: γ SB
 = 0.87; p = 0.614), LPA (BMI z-score: γ LPA  = 0.62; p = 0.213, WC: γ LPA
 = 0.23; p = 0.902), or MVPA (BMI z-score: γ MVPA  = -0.09; p = 0.733, WC: γ MVPA
 = 0.08; p = 0.288) relative to the other behaviours was not significantly
associated with the adiposity indicators.
CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to use compositional analyses when examining
associations of co-dependent sleep duration, sedentary time, and physical
activity behaviours with adiposity indicators in preschool-aged children. The
overall composition of movement behaviours appears important for healthy BMI
z-scores in preschool-aged children. Future research is needed to determine the
optimal movement behaviour composition that should be promoted in this age group.
