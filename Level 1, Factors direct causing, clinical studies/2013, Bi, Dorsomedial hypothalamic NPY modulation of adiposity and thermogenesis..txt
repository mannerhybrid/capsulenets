In addition to controlling food intake, the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH) plays 
an important role in thermoregulation. Within the DMH, a number of neuropeptides 
and receptors have been found and their roles in controlling energy balance are
being investigated. We recently found that the orexigenic neuropeptide Y (NPY) in
the DMH has specific actions on body adiposity and thermogenesis using a
viral-mediated manipulation of NPY in the DMH. Knockdown of NPY in the DMH
promotes the development of brown adipocytes in white adipose tissue and
increases brown adipocyte activity. DMH NPY knockdown also causes increased
thermogenesis and energy expenditure. Finally, DMH NPY knockdown prevents
high-fat diet-induced obesity and improves glucose homeostasis. This review
focuses on the role of DMH NPY in modulating body adiposity and thermogenesis.
