OBJECTIVE: Cell death determines the onset of obesity and associated insulin
resistance. Here, we analyze the relationship among obesity, adipose tissue
apoptosis, and insulin signaling.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The expression levels of initiator (CASP8/9) and
effector (CASP3/7) caspases as well as antiapoptotic B-cell lymphoma (BCL)2 and
inflammatory markers were assessed in visceral (VAT) and subcutaneous (SAT)
adipose tissue from patients with different degrees of obesity and without
insulin resistance or diabetes. Adipose tissue explants from lean subjects were
cultured with TNF-α or IL-6, and the expression of apoptotic and insulin
signaling components was analyzed and compared with basal expression levels in
morbidly obese subjects.
RESULTS: SAT and VAT exhibited increased CASP3/7 and CASP8/9 expression levels
and decreased BCL2 expression with BMI increase. These changes were accompanied
by increased inflammatory cytokine mRNA levels and macrophage infiltration
markers. In obese subjects, CASP3/7 activation and BCL2 downregulation correlated
with the IRS-1/2-expression levels. Expression levels of caspases, BCL2, p21,
p53, IRS-1/2, GLUT4, protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B, and leukocyte
antigen-related phosphatase in TNF-α- or IL-6-treated explants from lean subjects
were comparable with those found in adipose tissue samples from morbidly obese
subjects. These insulin component expression levels were reverted with CASP3/7
inhibition in these TNF-α- or IL-6-treated explants.
CONCLUSIONS: Body fat mass increase is associated with CASP3/7 and BCL2
expression in adipose tissue. Moreover, this proapoptotic state correlated with
insulin signaling, suggesting its potential contribution to the development of
insulin resistance.
