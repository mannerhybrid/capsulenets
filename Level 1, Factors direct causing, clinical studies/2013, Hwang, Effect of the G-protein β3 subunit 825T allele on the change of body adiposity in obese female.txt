No clinical studies on the lipolytic effect of guanine nucleotide-binding protein
β3 subunit gene (GNB3) 825T polymorphism have been performed. This study was a
subinvestigation of a 12-week randomized controlled trial (NCT01184560) for the
additive effect of orlistat on sibutramine treatment. The analysis involved 101
obese females aged 18-49 years, genotyped at the GNB3 825 locus. To exclude any
influence from potential confounders, we used an analysis of covariance model.
After the intervention, fat mass proportion in total weight loss was
significantly lower in subjects with a T allele than in those without a T allele 
(p = 0.034). GNB3 825T allele was associated with blunted fat mass reduction in
obese females.
