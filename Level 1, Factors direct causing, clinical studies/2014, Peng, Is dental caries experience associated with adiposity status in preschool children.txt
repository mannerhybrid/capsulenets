BACKGROUND: To date, research on the relationship between dental caries
experience and adiposity status is debated.
AIM: To determine associations between dental caries experience and adiposity
status among a community sample of preschool children in Hong Kong.
DESIGN: Among a random sample of 5-year-old children, clinical assessment for
dental caries was conducted using WHO criteria. Anthropometric measurements for
body weight, body height, waist circumference (WC), hip circumference, and
triceps skinfold thickness (TRSKF) were performed to assess general adiposity,
central adiposity, and peripheral adiposity. Associations between adiposity
status and caries were examined in regression analyses.
RESULTS: The response rate was 83.1% (324/390). Regression analyses (adjusted for
tooth brushing habits, snacking habits, and socio-demographic factors) identified
that weight/height ratio z-score was associated with caries experience:
prevalence of dental caries experience (dmft > 0), OR 1.41 (95% CI 1.04, 1.91),
and 'very high' caries experience (dmft ≥ SiC(10) Index value), OR 1.62, (95% CI 
1.05, 2.50). In addition, WC z-score was associated with 'very high' caries
experience (dmft ≥ SiC(10) Index value), OR 1.72, 95% CI 1.06, 2.81.
CONCLUSION: In a Hong Kong community sample of preschool children, dental caries 
experience was associated with general adiposity (as assessed by weight/height
ratio) and central adiposity (as assessed by WC).
