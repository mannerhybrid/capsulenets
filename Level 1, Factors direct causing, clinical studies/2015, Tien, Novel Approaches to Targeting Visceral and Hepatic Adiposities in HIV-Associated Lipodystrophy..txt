Visceral and hepatic adiposities have been associated with both cardiovascular
and liver disease and are of concern in HIV-infected persons in the modern era of
combination antiretroviral therapy (ART). The development of therapeutic targets 
to reduce visceral and hepatic adiposities in HIV-infected persons has been slow,
because of early reports that attributed the excess adiposity to specific
antiretroviral drugs. Visceral adiposity was initially thought to occur as part
of a protease inhibitor-induced "HIV-associated lipodystrophy syndrome."
Subsequent studies show that visceral adiposity is likely a result of effective
ART, recovery of health, and the normal aging process. Visceral adiposity is an
established risk factor for hepatic adiposity. Identifying drug targets for
non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is under active investigation. The present
review summarizes the recent literature on the pathogenesis of visceral and
hepatic adiposities in HIV-infected persons, current therapeutic strategies, and 
novel interventions in HIV-infected and uninfected persons.
