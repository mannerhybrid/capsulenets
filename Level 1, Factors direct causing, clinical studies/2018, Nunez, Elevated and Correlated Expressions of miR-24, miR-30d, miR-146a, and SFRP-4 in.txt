Objective: We explored the relationships among microRNAs (miRNAs) and SFRP4, as
they relate to adipose tissue functions including lipolysis, glucose and glycerol
turnover, and insulin sensitivity.
Methods: Abdominal adipose tissue (AbdAT) levels of thirteen microRNAs (miRNAs), 
SFRP4, and VEGF in lean nondiabetic subjects (n = 7), subjects with obesity (n = 
5), and subjects with obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2DM) (n = 5) were measured by
qPCR. Insulin sensitivity was measured by the euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp. 
Osmium fixation and Coulter counting were used for adipocyte sizing. Data were
analyzed using generalized linear models that adjusted for age, gender, and
ethnicity.
Results: AbdAT miR-24, miR-30d, and miR-146a were elevated in subjects with
obesity (P < 0.05) and T2DM (P < 0.1) and positively correlated with measures of 
percent body fat by DXA (rmiR.24 = 0.894, rmiR.146a = 0.883, P < 0.05), and AbdAT
SFRP4 (rmiR.30 = 0.93, rmiR.146a = 0.88, P < 0.05). These three miRNAs
additionally correlated among themselves (rmiR.24~miR.146a = 0.90,
rmiR.30~miR.146a = 0.85, P < 0.01).
Conclusions: This study suggests a novel association between the elevated levels 
of miRNAs miR-24, miR-30d, and miR-146a (apparently coregulated) and the level of
SFRP4 transcript in AbdAT of subjects with obesity and T2DM. These molecules
might be part of a regulatory loop involved in AbdAT remodeling/adiposity and
systemic insulin resistance. This trial is registered with NCT00704197.
