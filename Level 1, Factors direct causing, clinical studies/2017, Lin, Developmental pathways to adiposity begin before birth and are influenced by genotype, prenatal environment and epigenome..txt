BACKGROUND: Obesity is an escalating health problem worldwide, and hence the
causes underlying its development are of primary importance to public health.
There is growing evidence that suboptimal intrauterine environment can perturb
the metabolic programing of the growing fetus, thereby increasing the risk of
developing obesity in later life. However, the link between early exposures in
the womb, genetic susceptibility, and perturbed epigenome on metabolic health is 
not well understood. In this study, we shed more light on this aspect by
performing a comprehensive analysis on the effects of variation in prenatal
environment, neonatal methylome, and genotype on birth weight and adiposity in
early childhood.
METHODS: In a prospective mother-offspring cohort (N = 987), we interrogated the 
effects of 30 variables that influence the prenatal environment, umbilical cord
DNA methylation, and genotype on offspring weight and adiposity, over the period 
from birth to 48 months. This is an interim analysis on an ongoing cohort study.
RESULTS: Eleven of 30 prenatal environments, including maternal adiposity,
smoking, blood glucose and plasma unsaturated fatty acid levels, were associated 
with birth weight. Polygenic risk scores derived from genetic association studies
on adult adiposity were also associated with birth weight and child adiposity,
indicating an overlap between the genetic pathways influencing metabolic health
in early and later life. Neonatal methylation markers from seven gene loci (ANK3,
CDKN2B, CACNA1G, IGDCC4, P4HA3, ZNF423 and MIRLET7BHG) were significantly
associated with birth weight, with a subset of these in genes previously
implicated in metabolic pathways in humans and in animal models. Methylation
levels at three of seven birth weight-linked loci showed significant association 
with prenatal environment, but none were affected by polygenic risk score. Six of
these birth weight-linked loci continued to show a longitudinal association with 
offspring size and/or adiposity in early childhood.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides further evidence that developmental pathways to 
adiposity begin before birth and are influenced by environmental, genetic and
epigenetic factors. These pathways can have a lasting effect on offspring size,
adiposity and future metabolic outcomes, and offer new opportunities for risk
stratification and prevention of obesity.
CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: This birth cohort is a prospective observational
study, designed to study the developmental origins of health and disease, and was
retrospectively registered on 1 July 2010 under the identifier NCT01174875 .
