PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between sleep 
patterns and adiposity in young adult women.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional.
SETTING: The study took place at two Mountain West region universities and
surrounding communities.
SUBJECTS: Subjects were 330 young adult women (20.2 Â± 1.5 years).
MEASURES: Sleep and physical activity were monitored for 7 consecutive days and
nights using actigraphy. Height and weight were measured directly. Adiposity was 
assessed using the BOD POD.
ANALYSIS: Regression analysis, between subjects analysis of variance, and
structural equation modeling were used.
RESULTS: Bivariate regression analysis demonstrated that sleep efficiency was
negatively related to adiposity and that the 7-day standard deviations of
bedtime, wake time, and sleep duration were positively related to adiposity (p < 
.05). Controlling for objectively measured physical activity strengthened the
relationship between sleep duration and adiposity by 84% but had a statistically 
negligible impact on all other relationships that were analyzed. However,
multivariate structural equation modeling indicated that a model including sleep 
efficiency, sleep pattern inconsistency (latent variable consisting of the 7-day 
standard deviations of bedtime, wake time, and sleep duration), and physical
activity was the best for predicting percent body fat.
CONCLUSION: Inconsistent sleep patterns and poor sleep efficiency are related to 
adiposity. Consistent sleep patterns that include sufficient sleep may be
important in modifying risk of excess body fat in young adult women.
