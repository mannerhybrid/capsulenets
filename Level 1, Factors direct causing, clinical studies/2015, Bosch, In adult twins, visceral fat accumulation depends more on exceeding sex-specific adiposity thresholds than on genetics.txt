adiposity thresholds than on genetics.

OBJECTIVE: We recently reported sex-specific percent body fat (%BF) thresholds
(males=23%, females=38%) above which, visceral adipose tissue (VAT) significantly
increases. Using monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins, we examined the
influence of genetics on regional fat distribution measured by dual-energy X-ray 
absorptiometry, above and below these sex-specific thresholds for VAT
accumulation.
METHODS: Fifty-eight twin pairs (44 MZ, 14 DZ) were recruited from the University
of Washington Twin Registry. Segmented linear regression was used to assess the
threshold between VAT mass and %BF by sex and by zygosity. To assess the effect
of genetics on VAT accumulation, Dunnett's T3 compared MZ and DZ pairs whether
the twin pairs were both above the adiposity threshold or not.
RESULTS: %BF thresholds for VAT accumulation were identified (%BF: M=20.6%,
F=39.4%). Zygosity-specific thresholds were not significantly different (p>0.05).
If at least one twin was below threshold, DZ twins still exhibited greater
within-pair differences than MZ pairs in %BF (p=0.023) but not VAT (p=0.121).
CONCLUSIONS: Using a twin study approach, we observed no difference by zygosity
for the threshold as which VAT accumulates. Additionally, for the first time we
observed that while total BF is influenced by genetics, VAT accumulation may
depend more on whether a person's %BF is above their sex-specific adiposity
threshold. These results suggest that there may not be a genetic predisposition
for VAT accumulation but rather it is a result of a predisposition for total fat 
accumulation.
