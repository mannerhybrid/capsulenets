The Relationship of Insulin-Like Growth Factor 2 to Fetal Growth and Adiposity.

Kadakia R, Josefson J.

Insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF-2) is necessary for adequate human growth.
Overexpression of the IGF2 gene is associated with fetal overgrowth and may play 
a role in the intrauterine programming of adipose tissue. As obesity in children 
is a major public health problem associated with early onset of comorbid
metabolic diseases, identifying early life markers of obesity may serve as useful
tool for counseling and implementation of preventive efforts before obesity
develops. The relationship between IGF-2 and body composition is an emerging
field of study and existing data are conflicting. In this review, we discuss the 
IGF2 gene and its function, highlight the proposed mechanisms for the effects of 
IGF-2 on adiposity, and examine the current literature studying the relationships
between IGF-2 levels, changes within the IGF2 gene, weight, and adiposity. With
additional study, IGF-2 may emerge as a useful marker of future obesity risk in
infants.
