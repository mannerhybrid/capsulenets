BACKGROUND: Dietary studies differ in design and quality making it difficult to
compare results. This study quantifies the prospective association between
dietary energy density (DED) and adiposity in children using a meta-analysis
method that adjusts for differences in design and quality through eliciting and
incorporating expert opinion on the biases and their uncertainty.
METHOD: Six prospective studies identified by a previous systematic literature
search were included. Differences in study quality and design were considered
respectively as internal and external biases and captured in bias checklists.
Study results were converted to correlation coefficients; biases were considered 
either additive or proportional on this scale. The extent and uncertainty of the 
internal and external biases in each study were elicited in a formal process by
five quantitatively-trained assessors and five subject-matter specialists. Biases
for each study were combined across assessors using median pooling and results
combined across studies by random-effects meta-analysis.
RESULTS: The unadjusted combined correlation between DED and adiposity change was
0.06 (95%CI 0.01, 0.11; p = 0.013), but with considerable heterogeneity (I² =
52%). After bias-adjustment the pooled correlation was 0.17 (95%CI - 0.11, 0.45; 
p = 0.24), and the studies were apparently compatible (I² = 0%).
CONCLUSIONS: This method allowed quantitative synthesis of the prospective
association between DED and adiposity change in children, which is important for 
the development of evidence-informed policy. Bias adjustment increased the
magnitude of the positive association but the widening confidence interval
reflects the uncertainty of the assessed biases and implies that higher quality
studies are required.
